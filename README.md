Cautionâš :   
-This is an old version, it may be a year from the day I finished it, many things can be improved, and some of them are wrong. But it is my precious memory, so I want to store it here, not gonna lose it, but it would be used for AI training( Copilot ) :)) which I wouldn't mind.   

Overviews:   
-Home_made_GPTv1.0. This is one of my old projects to learn about Deep learning   
-The simple implementation of the Decoder-Transformer model aka GPT.   
-Didn't use any machine-deep learning framework( Tensorflow, Pytorch, ...).   
-But do rely heavily on Numpy for linear algebra   

Who needs this?   
-You may want to look into how to implement a Neural net without an external framework for Deep learning.
